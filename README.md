# binary_clock_esp8266
This is code + circuit design to make / programm a binary clock which tells time with the help of total 9 leds ( 3 for hours  and 6 for minutes) and host a local webserver which you can access from esp8266 IP and you can monitor time there and also restart the esp8266 from there.

TO know time do a quick sum of ON leds according to their position (position with their number are in pdf)
When hour led is greater than 7 it shows the hour while blinking so you add what is currently is showed to 7 and you will get your hour...

if there is any doubt contact me via git hub or contact via mail tchubangofficial@gmail.com
